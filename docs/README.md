## Project Management Process Overview

OctoAcme employs a structured, iterative approach to project management designed to deliver customer value through clear roles, collaborative planning, and continuous improvement. Projects progress through defined stages—initiation, planning, execution, release, and retrospectives—ensuring consistency in how ideas are validated, teams align, and outcomes are measured. At initiation, every project creates a one-pager with the problem statement, stakeholders, metrics, and early resource needs to align the team and sponsors on the project’s intent.

The backbone of OctoAcme’s repeatability is its explicitly documented personas and roles. Project Managers (PMs) drive schedule, coordination, risk, and stakeholder communications. Product Managers (PdMs) own vision, prioritization, and how success is measured. Developers and QA focus on delivering high-quality software and validating acceptance criteria. By clarifying which responsibilities and communication flows belong to which roles, OctoAcme boosts accountability and teamwork throughout each project phase.

Key workflows include collaborative backlog and milestone planning, a robust execution and tracking routine (with daily standups, project boards, and PR workflows), and a deliberate quality bar held by automated and manual tests. Risk management, stakeholder notification, and escalation paths are standardized so issues are surfaced and addressed early. Regular demo sessions and metrics dashboards keep all contributors and stakeholders in-the-loop and focused on shared delivery outcomes.

Continuous improvement is embedded with post-milestone retrospectives, action item tracking, and a culture of learning. Every project formalizes what went well and what needs to change, feeding lessons learned directly back into these living docs. This ensures OctoAcme’s delivery practices adapt and evolve, reducing reliance on institutional memory and supporting every teammate—new or tenured—in delivering high-quality outcomes, consistently.
